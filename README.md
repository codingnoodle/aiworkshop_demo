# 🏥 Patient & Caregiver Trial Navigator

A comprehensive Streamlit web application that helps patients and caregivers find and understand clinical trials for specific medical conditions. The app uses LangGraph to create a stateful, multi-step agent that interacts with the ClinicalTrials.gov API to provide personalized trial information.

## 🆕 What's New

**🤖 Local AI Integration**: The app now includes optional Ollama support for enhanced AI responses without external APIs. All AI features work out of the box with smart fallbacks, but you can enhance them with local models for better performance and privacy.

## 🎯 What This App Does

This application is designed to bridge the gap between complex clinical trial information and patients who need it. It transforms technical medical jargon into understandable insights, helping you:

- **Find relevant clinical trials** for your specific condition
- **Understand if you might qualify** based on age, gender, and other factors
- **See where trials are happening** with an interactive world map
- **Learn about trial phases** and what they mean for you
- **Get simplified explanations** of complex eligibility criteria

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### What is this app?
This is a **clinical trial search and analysis tool** that helps patients and caregivers find relevant clinical trials and understand if they might qualify.

### Is this medical advice?
**No.** This app provides information about clinical trials but does not give medical advice. Always consult with your healthcare provider.

### How current is the trial information?
The app pulls data directly from ClinicalTrials.gov, which is updated regularly. However, trial status can change quickly, so always verify with the trial site.

### What if I don't see any trials for my condition?
- Try different variations of your condition name
- Check related conditions
- Some rare conditions may have limited trial options
- Consider expanding your search geographically

### How do I contact a trial site?
Click on any trial marker on the map or expand a trial card to get the direct link to ClinicalTrials.gov, where you can find contact information.

### Are these trials free?
Clinical trials often provide the treatment at no cost, but you should discuss costs with the trial coordinator. Some trials may cover travel expenses.

### What if I'm not eligible for any trials?

## 🚫 What This App Is NOT

- **Medical advice** - Always consult healthcare professionals
- **A replacement for doctor consultation** - Use this as a starting point
- **A guarantee of trial participation** - Eligibility is determined by trial sites
- **Real-time trial status** - Information may have slight delays

## 🏗️ Architecture

### LangGraph Agent Structure

The application uses LangGraph to create a stateful workflow with the following nodes:

1. **`clarify_disease`**: Checks if user input needs clarification
2. **`search_clinical_trials`**: Queries ClinicalTrials.gov API
3. **`summarize_eligibility`**: Uses LLM to simplify eligibility criteria
4. **`prepare_visualizations`**: Processes data for charts and maps

### State Management

The agent maintains state through a `TypedDict` structure:
- `messages`: Conversation history
- `disease_name`: Current search term
- `api_results`: Raw API response data
- `simplified_criteria`: LLM-processed eligibility criteria
- `visualization_data`: Processed data for charts

## 🔧 Configuration

### AI Model Setup

The app automatically detects and uses the best available AI model:

**Default (No Setup Required)**: Smart fallback responses for all AI features  
**With Ollama**: Enhanced AI responses using local models  
**With API Keys**: OpenAI/Anthropic integration (requires configuration)

**Quick Ollama Setup**:
```bash
# Install and run Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
ollama serve

# The app will automatically detect and use it!
```

### API Configuration

The app uses the ClinicalTrials.gov API v2. No API key is required, but you can customize:
- `pageSize`: Number of trials per request (default: 50)
- `fields`: Specific data fields to retrieve
- `filter.overallStatus`: Trial status filter (default: "RECRUITING")

## 📊 Data Sources

- **ClinicalTrials.gov API v2**: Primary source for trial data
- **Fields Retrieved**:
  - Trial identifiers (NCT ID)
  - Basic information (title, condition, status)
  - Location data (city, country, coordinates)
  - Sponsor information
  - Eligibility criteria
  - Intervention details

## 🎨 Customization

### Styling

The app uses custom CSS for styling. Modify the CSS in the `st.markdown` section to change:
- Colors and fonts
- Layout spacing
- Card styling
- Header appearance

### Visualizations

Customize charts by modifying:
- **Map**: Change pin colors, sizes, or add custom popups
- **Pie Chart**: Adjust colors, labels, or chart type
- **Word Cloud**: Modify colors, word limits, or layout

### Agent Logic

Extend the LangGraph workflow by:
- Adding new nodes for additional processing
- Implementing conditional edges for complex workflows
- Enhancing the clarification logic for better disease detection

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check Python version compatibility

2. **API Timeouts**
   - The ClinicalTrials.gov API may be slow. Increase timeout in the `requests.get()` call
   - Consider implementing retry logic for failed requests

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Large datasets may cause memory problems
   - Reduce `pageSize` in API requests
   - Implement pagination for large result sets

4. **LLM Integration**
   - **For Ollama**: Ensure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`) and models are downloaded
   - **For OpenAI/Anthropic**: Ensure API keys are properly configured
   - Check rate limits for your chosen LLM provider

5. **Ollama Issues** (if using enhanced AI features)
   - **Model not found**: Run `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`
   - **Connection failed**: Run `ollama serve` in terminal
   - **Slow responses**: Try `ollama pull phi3:mini` for faster inference

### Performance Optimization

- Use `@st.cache_resource` for expensive operations
- Implement lazy loading for large datasets
- Consider using async requests for API calls
