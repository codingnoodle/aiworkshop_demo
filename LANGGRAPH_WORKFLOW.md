# ðŸ§  How the AI System Works - Simple Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **What This App Does**

The Clinical Trials Navigator uses an AI system called **LangGraph** to help you find the best clinical trials for your condition. Think of it as a smart assistant that:

1. **Understands** what you're looking for
2. **Searches** thousands of clinical trials
3. **Matches** trials to your personal situation
4. **Explains** everything in simple terms
5. **Learns** and improves its results

## ðŸ”„ **The AI Workflow (Step by Step)**

### **Step 1: Understanding Your Request**
- **What happens**: AI reads your input (like "diabetes")
- **Why it matters**: Makes sure it understands exactly what you need
- **Example**: "diabetes" â†’ AI clarifies "Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes?"

### **Step 2: Searching Clinical Trials**
- **What happens**: AI searches ClinicalTrials.gov database
- **Why it matters**: Finds all relevant trials for your condition
- **Example**: Searches for "diabetes" trials across the world

### **Step 3: Simplifying Medical Jargon**
- **What happens**: AI translates complex medical terms into plain English
- **Why it matters**: Makes trial information understandable
- **Example**: "HbA1c < 7%" â†’ "Blood sugar levels under control"

### **Step 4: Creating Visualizations**
- **What happens**: AI creates maps, charts, and graphs
- **Why it matters**: Makes data easy to see and understand
- **Example**: World map showing where trials are happening

### **Step 5: Personal Matching**
- **What happens**: AI matches trials to your age, location, and preferences
- **Why it matters**: Shows you the most relevant trials
- **Example**: Prioritizes trials near your location

### **Step 6: Risk Analysis**
- **What happens**: AI analyzes trial safety and risks
- **Why it matters**: Helps you understand what to expect
- **Example**: "Low risk" or "Moderate risk" for each trial

### **Step 7: Quality Check & Improvement**
- **What happens**: AI checks if results are good enough
- **Why it matters**: Ensures you get the best possible matches
- **Example**: If too few trials found, AI searches with different terms
