```

## üéØ Workshop Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Search (5 minutes)
1. **Launch the app**: `streamlit run app.py`
2. **Test search**: Enter "diabetes" in the chat box
3. **Explore results**: 
   - Look at the trial count
   - Check the interactive map
   - Click on map markers
   - Expand trial cards

### Exercise 2: Profile Personalization (5 minutes)
1. **Open sidebar**: Look for "üë§ User Profile & Preferences"
2. **Fill your profile**:
   - Age: Your current age
   - Gender: Your preference
   - Location: Your preferred trial location
   - Risk Tolerance: How comfortable with experimental treatments
   - Travel Preference: How far you're willing to travel
3. **See changes**: Notice how recommendations update automatically

### Exercise 3: Advanced Features (10 minutes)
1. **Search different conditions**:
   - "breast cancer"
   - "multiple sclerosis" 
   - "Alzheimer's disease"
2. **Explore Story Journey**: Look at the workflow visualization
3. **Check risk assessments**: See how trials are categorized by risk
4. **Try eligibility summaries**: See how AI simplifies complex criteria

### Exercise 4: Interactive Features (5 minutes)
1. **Map exploration**: Click different colored markers
2. **Trial details**: Expand cards to see full information
3. **Demographics**: Check age groups and gender requirements
4. **Phase analysis**: Understand what different trial phases mean

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] App launches without errors
- [ ] Can search for "diabetes"
- [ ] Map loads with trial markers
- [ ] Can expand trial cards
- [ ] Profile sidebar works
- [ ] Personalized recommendations appear
- [ ] Story Journey section shows workflow

## üîß Troubleshooting

### App won't start?
```bash
# Check Python version (need 3.8+)
python --version

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Try alternative launch
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

### Import errors?
```bash
# Install missing packages
pip install streamlit requests pandas plotly folium streamlit-folium

# For LangGraph features
pip install langgraph langchain-core langchain-openai
```

### Map not loading?
- Check internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- App works without map too!

### Slow performance?
- This is normal for first-time setup
- Subsequent searches will be faster
- Large datasets may take a moment to process
