# üéì Clinical Trials Navigator - Workshop Setup Guide

Complete setup guide for the Clinical Trials Navigator workshop with OpenAI integration.

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### For Workshop Participants

**üéì Recommended: Fork First (Personal Copy)**
1. **Go to**: `https://github.com/codingnoodle/aiworkshop_demo`
2. **Click "Fork"** button (creates your personal copy)
3. **Verify you're in your fork**: URL should show `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiworkshop_demo`
4. **Go to your fork** ‚Üí **"Code"** ‚Üí **"Codespaces"** ‚Üí **"Create codespace"**
5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for setup
6. **Run**: `streamlit run app.py`
7. **Click the URL** that appears in the terminal
8. **Start exploring**: Enter "diabetes" in the chat box
9. **Experiment freely**: Make changes, try different approaches!

**‚úÖ How to Know You Forked Correctly:**
- **URL shows your username**: `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiworkshop_demo`
- **You see "forked from codingnoodle/aiworkshop_demo"** at the top
- **You can see the "Fork" button** (it will show your fork count)

**‚ö° Quick Demo (No Fork)**
1. **Go to**: `https://github.com/codingnoodle/aiworkshop_demo`
2. **Click "Code"** ‚Üí **"Codespaces"** ‚Üí **"Create codespace"**
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for setup
4. **Run**: `streamlit run app.py`
5. **Note**: Changes will be lost when Codespace closes

### For Instructors

1. **Set up repository secret** (see API Key Setup section below)
2. **Share repository link** with participants
3. **Emphasize forking** - Make it clear this is required, not optional
4. **Guide through exercises** (see Workshop Exercises section)

#### **Preventing "Forgot to Fork" Issues:**

**Before Workshop:**
- **Send instructions early** - Include fork requirement in pre-workshop email
- **Create a checklist** - "Step 1: Fork the repository"
- **Show the fork button** - Point out exactly where to click

**During Workshop:**
- **Start with forking** - First 5 minutes dedicated to forking
- **Check everyone** - "Raise your hand if you see your username in the URL"
- **Verify forks** - Have participants confirm they're in their own repository

#### **Recovery: If Someone Forgot to Fork**

**Option 1: Fork Now (Recommended)**
1. **Go to**: `https://github.com/codingnoodle/aiworkshop_demo`
2. **Click "Fork"** button
3. **Close current Codespace**
4. **Go to your fork** ‚Üí **"Code"** ‚Üí **"Codespaces"** ‚Üí **"Create codespace"**
5. **Start over** - You'll have your personal copy

**Option 2: Continue Without Fork (Limited)**
- **Can still participate** - App works the same
- **Changes will be lost** - When Codespace closes
- **No experimentation** - Can't modify code
- **Good for**: Just following along, not experimenting

**Option 3: Export Changes (Advanced)**
- **Download files** - Save any modifications locally
- **Fork later** - Apply changes to your fork
- **Complex** - Not recommended for beginners

## üîë API Key Setup (Instructors Only)

### Option 1: Repository Secret (Recommended)
1. **Get workshop API key** from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. **Set repository secret**:
   - Go to `https://github.com/codingnoodle/aiworkshop_demo/settings/secrets/actions`
   - Click **"New repository secret"**
   - **Name**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your workshop API key
   - Click **"Add secret"**
3. **Participants automatically get access** - no individual setup needed!

### Option 2: Individual API Keys
If participants use their own keys:
1. **In Codespace**: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. **Add**: `OPENAI_API_KEY` = their personal key
3. **Restart Codespace**

## üîß Troubleshooting

### App won't start?
```bash
# Check Python version (need 3.8+)
python --version

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Try alternative launch
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

### OpenAI API issues?
```bash
# Check API key format (should start with sk-)
# Verify API key is valid at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# Check if you have credits in your OpenAI account
```

### Import errors?
```bash
# Install missing packages
pip install streamlit requests pandas plotly folium streamlit-folium

# For OpenAI features
pip install langchain-openai langgraph langchain-core
```

### API rate limits?
