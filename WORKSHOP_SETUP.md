## üîß Troubleshooting

### App won't start?
```bash
# Check Python version (need 3.8+)
python --version

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Try alternative launch
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

### OpenAI API issues?
```bash
# Check API key format (should start with sk-)
# Verify API key is valid at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# Check if you have credits in your OpenAI account
```

### Import errors?
```bash
# Install missing packages
pip install streamlit requests pandas plotly folium streamlit-folium

# For OpenAI features
pip install langchain-openai langgraph langchain-core
```

### API rate limits?
- OpenAI has rate limits based on your plan
- Try using GPT-3.5-turbo instead of GPT-4 for lower costs
- Check your usage at https://platform.openai.com/usage

### Map not loading?
- Check internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- App works without map too!

## üí∞ Cost Information

### Estimated Workshop Costs
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: ~$0.001-0.002 per request
- **GPT-4**: ~$0.01-0.03 per request
- **Typical workshop usage**: $0.50-2.00 total per participant

### Cost Optimization Tips
- Use GPT-3.5-turbo for most tasks (cheaper and faster)
- Use GPT-4 only for complex medical clarifications
- Monitor usage at [OpenAI Usage Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
